# Proof of Completion + Time

I got a 47/50 and spent around 1.5 hours on this test. 

# My Mistakes 
I got three questions wrong: Q17, Q19, Q20. Q17 is representative of skill 5.A while both Q's 19 and 20 are representative of skill 1.D. 

### Q17 - Purpose of Internet protocols. Skill 5.A: Investigating Computing Solutions
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ki.png" alt="AP COMPUTER SCIENCE PRINCIPLES" width="500" height="500"> 
I put A, "Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance," while the correct answer was, "Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices." A is incorrect because data being rounted isn't specified or stated before. D is correct because protocols are rules that can standardize the communication of data. I got this question wrong because I didn't know the content and because I guessed.

### Q19 - Adding numbers in 4-bit representation. Skill 1.D: Design and Evaluate Computational Solutions for a purpose. 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/p.png" alt="AP COMPUTER SCIENCE PRINCIPLES" width="500" height="500"> 
I put A, "The correct sum of 29 will be assigned to the variable total", while the correct answer is C, An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15. A is incorrect because 29 as a sum is too large to be represnted with 4-bits. C is correct because and overflow error will occur for any representation after 15. I got this question wrong because I didn't consider how big of a value 29 is, I just assumed that the 4-bit representation will work for anything. 


### Q20 - Bits needed to represent directions. Skill 1.D: Design and Evaluate Computational Solutions for a purpose.
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/r.png" alt="AP COMPUTER SCIENCE PRINCIPLES" width="500" height="500"> 
I put A, "Four bits are not enough to store the eight directions. Five bits are needed for the new version of the game," while the correct answer is D, "Four bits are enough to store the eight directions." A is incorrect because you don't need to add new bits to store the 8 directions, four bits can store 16. D is correct because 8 is less than 16, so all 8 bits can be stored. I got this question wrong because I forgot that four bits can represent 16 pieces of information.
