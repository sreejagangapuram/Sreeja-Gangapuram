# Big Idea 3-4: Mathematical Expressions and Strings 
## Algorithms 
### What is an Algorithm? 
**Algorithm**: a set of instructions that can accompish a specific task. 

### An Algorithm has Three Components 
1) **Sequencing**: Algorithms do tasks in the order of specification.

2) **Selection**: Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision to make.

3) **Iteration**: If something is true, then the code repeats. An example of this would be a "For loop"

### Two Ways to Represent Algorithms 
1) **Flowcharts**: Use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm.

2) **Psudocode**: A blend of human language and coding format. "Fake code."

### Hacks 
- Open up a new blog post and title it "Big Idea 3-4 (Mathematical Expressions and Strings) - Algorithm Hacks." 
- Then, design an algorithm to add two numbers and display the result.
    - Number the steps in your algorithm 
    - Use around 5-7 steps 
    - HINT: DON'T FORGET THE "START" AND "STOP" STEPS 
- Lastly, make a flowchart **OR** psudocode reprsentation of the steps that you wrote. 
    - For flowcharts: Use corrent shapes and lines. Feel free to ask to view the example above. Make your flowchart in google drawings. 
    - For psudocode: Do five minutes of extra reaserch to understand the basic formatting and rules of psudocode
