# Video 1 Notes 
- purpose of computing innovations: **to solve problems or pursue interests thru creative expression**
- an understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides devolopers with an improved ability to develop innovation 
- computing innovations: 
    - applications: games, social media, business, productivity 
    - physical devices: computers, smart phones/tablets, smart "things", wearables 
    - **systems: E-commerce, cloud services, E-mail**
- Guiding questions:
    - why does the computing ino=ovation exist? 
    - what problems does the computing innovation solve? 
    - what does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before? 
- investigating examples: 
    - social media applications
        - allows users to connect from a distance and archive activities 
    - E-commerce
        - allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home
    - digital assistant device
        - allows users to control their devices hands-free, making them safer while driving or more conveinent when multi-tasking 

# Video 2 Notes 
- **program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program.** input forms: tactile, audio, visual, or text 
- an event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program 
- events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution 
- inputs usually affect the outpout produced by a program 
- in event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control 
- input can come from a user or other programs 
- program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text
- program output is usually based on a program's input or prior state (ex:internal values)
- input: 
    - tactile (touch)
    - audio 
    - visual
    - text (including numerical values)
- what input devices accept: 
    - smart phone/tablet 
    - laptop computer 
    - gaming console 
- **event driven enviorment: "events" are triggered by some action, usually sends input to the program**
    - mouse clicks 
    - screen taps/swipes (force touch)
    - physical button entries 
    - keyboard entires 
    - audio 
- what does input acconplish:
    - affects the output. what outputs are produced by a device? 
        - visual 
        - audio 
        - tactile (touch/feel)
        - text 
    - outputs 
        - smart phone/tablet 
        - laptop computer
        - gaming console 
- an action triggers an event:
    - action may be initated by the user or other program/device 
    - program jumps to code segement according to event 
        - code is executed
        - output or additional events are triggered 
        - executed as called

# Video 3 Notes 
- A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. a program is often referred to as software. 
- a code segment is a collection of pogram statements that is part of a program 
- a program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations 
- the behavior of a program is how a prgram functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it 
- a program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accompish this function 
- a program: a collection of statements
    - **statement: a single command**
    - code segment: group of statements
        - exectued accoridng to the rules ofo the proframming lanuage 
    - **a program = software**
- how to describe a code segment: 
    - state what is does, simply 
        - so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program 
    - or include how it does what it does: 
        - explain how the code segment functions 
        - so that someone can expand upon the code segment

# Questions Answered: Final Project
Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project?
- Yes we do, we are planning on making a wordle. 
Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose?
- Yes we are. A wordle must have many elements that can help us develop our coding skills. 
Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks?
- Yes. All of our team members are interested in this project. 
Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed?
- Yes, people can play our game after the four weeks. 
Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission?
- Most likely. We can add more complexity to our code to achive a higher grade.
