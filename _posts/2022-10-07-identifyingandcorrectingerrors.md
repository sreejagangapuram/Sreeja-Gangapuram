title: 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors
--- 

# Video 1
- a logic error is a mistake in the algortithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly 
- syntax error: mistake in the program where rules of language aren't followed 
- run-time error: mistake in the program that occurs during execution, 
- workflow error: occurs when a computer attempts to handle number outside of defined values 

# Video 2
- effective ways to test errors: 
    - test cases
    - hand tracing 
    - visualizations 
    - debuggers 
    - adding extra output statements 
- syntax error: this information is stated, the particular line is given 
- logic errors: the program runs, but is behaving unexpectedly, not immediately noticed, use test cases to find logic errors. 
- hand tracing: writing out the values of the variables within the loop as it iterates to determine if the output is correct 
- use visualizations and debuggers if other stratagies don't work 

# Video 3 
- testing uses defined inputs to ensure that program is producing expected outcomes 
- results can be used for testing 
- defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate expected outcomes 
- program requirments are needed to identify defined inputs for testing 
- think about program specifications (list events, behaviors, respondings)
