title: College Board Video Topic 1.3 - Program Design and Development Notes 
--- 

# Video 1 
- dev process: ordered + intentional or exloratory 
    - investigating and reflecting
    - designing 
    - prototyping
    - testing 
- dev process requires revision based on testing and experiance 
    - breaks down the steps before adding it to the whole 
    - adds investiagtion to determine requirments
        - collecting data through surveys 
        - user testing 
        - interviews 
        - direct observations 
-  program requirements describe how a program functions and many include a description of user interactions 
- in a dev process, the design phase outlines how to accompish a given specification 
- design phase: 
    - brainstorming 
    - planning/storyboarding 
    - organizing the program into modules 
    - creation of diagrams that represent the user interface 
    - development of a testing stategy for the program 
- starts with an idea 
    - dev with purpose 
- start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect 
- determine requirments 
- understand constraints  
- investigtion
- design the program 
    - story boarding 
    - planning user experiance 
    - organizing into modules 
    - develop a testing statagy 
- decide on program reqirments: highlight them in the program specifications 
- create a prototye 
- testing (micro level and macro level)
- refine 

# Video 2 
- acknowlege code segments used by another source or developed collabrotively 
- do this in the program documentation: inclide orgin or orginonal author's name 
- programs are usually developed by teams of people 
- indivuals work on different functional components 
- each member deserves to recive credit for work in the documentation (list names)
- comments with names giving credit 

# Video 3 
- program documentation: written description of function of code segemnt, event, procedure, or program, and how it was develiped 
- commentats = form of documetation 
- document throughout development 
- some enviorments don't support comments 
- program documentation 
    - describe overall program 
    - list specifications 
- document 
    - in the beggining 
    - during: to keep track of process 
    - after: to explain the overall process 
- documentation can improve: 
    - efficiency 
    - programmers' ability to test + refine the program 
    - programmers' respose to bugs 
    - comments can be useful when programmers work collaboratively 
- Examples of comments 
    - python: on lines that follow the hastag symbol 
    - java: single line comments appear after // and /* is for multiple line comments and /** documentation comments, end with another foreward slash
