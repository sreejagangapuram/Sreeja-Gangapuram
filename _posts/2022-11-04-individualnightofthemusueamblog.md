# Night of the Musuem
## My Visits to Classrooms 
I really enjoyed walking through all of the classrooms and getting to see everyone's creations. The visits to the art classrooms were very relaxing while I was in awe of the work of the CSA students. 

### AP Studio Art

The first classroom that I visited was the AP Studio Art classroom. I went with my friend and fellow group member Claire and CSA students Aadya and Saumya. I was especially interested in this class's work because I'm planning on taking this class next year. I got to see all of the different pieces of artwork and was blown away by some of them. It was a relaxing experiance right before my cs presentation. 

### Ceramics

The second classroom that I visited was the Ceramics room. I went into this classroom with Claire because the amazing pots and creations caught my eye. We checked out all of the pieces and recognized some of the names of the creators. It was nice to see what my friends had made. 

### CSA

We also went into the CSA classroom before going into the CSP one. I was blown away by how expertly the CSA students were explaining their projects. They seemed to understand every part of their projects very well. Their presentations were professional and insightful. 

### CSP

And lastly, we went into the CSP room for our shift. We got to see some of our peers getting ready for their presentations. 

### Working 
During the process of getting ready for our presentation and shift, I took some pictures of my group.

Here my group is fixing up our code before the presentation. We were having trouble with our table appearing, so we were attempting to fix any errors and troubleshoot.

Before calling our teacher over, our group practiced our presentation. We assigned ourselves parts of the project to present. 

## Ideas for Next Trimester
What really gave me ideas and insight for next trimester was listening to my CSP peers and CSA students. 

### Listening to CSP/Peers

Before leaving, me and my group listened to a CSP group's presentation of their project. In comparison to our group, this group's project was fully put together. All components of their project were working properly. We had the same amount of time to work on our projects, but our group's wasn't fully complete. This told me that we needed to better work on our time management and problem solving skills. I belive that my group did a good job of utilizing in class time, but outside of class, we should have met up more often to work on the code. Next trimester I plan to make time for my group to meet outside of class. In addition, to fix errors in our code, next trimester, we could utlize our teachers and online reasources more intensly.

### Listening to CSA

This is a picture of a CSA group presenting to my group. This group was very professional in their presenting and had a lot of knowlege about their project. Next trimester, I belive my group's presentation should be more put together and professional. I plan to have practice presention sessions with my group in order to make our presentation more seamless.

In this picture, my group is studying the CSA group's use of an API. This group used an API fantastically to give song reccomenations based on a person's mood. In addition, we could also vote if we liked their reccomendation in thier project. I thought that a personalized use of an API was very interesting and creative. This would be a great idea for my next trimester final project.
