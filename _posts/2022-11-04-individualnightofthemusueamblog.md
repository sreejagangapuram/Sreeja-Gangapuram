The first classroom that I visited was the AP Studio Art classroom. I went with my friend and fellow group member Claire and CSA students Aadya and Saumya. I was especially interested in this class's work because I'm planning on taking this class next year. I got to see all of the different pieces of artwork and was blown away by some of them. It was a relaxing experiance right before my cs presentation.
