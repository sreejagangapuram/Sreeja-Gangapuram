## App or Webpage Ideas Brainstorming
- A study app
- A workout planner/tracker
- Wordle Game 

## Wordle Game
- Similar to the New York Times "Wordle" 
- Normal mode: 
    - 6 tries to guess 
        - Blue: letters are in the word, not correct space
        - Green: letters are in the word, and in the correct space
        - Grey: letters are not in the word
    - A word is five letters
- Second mode: change number of letters, change allowed guesses, set a time limit, do specific genres or topics
- Ideas to implement
    - add hints: gives letters that are in the words, reveals one
    - stats/scores after every few games
    - clear the screen
- Knowlege needed: webpage, user input, animations, keyboard

## What I will do personally to improve my coding skills before create performance task. 

Here are some ideas that I will use to learn more about coding: 
- Going though the AP computer science principles videos on Khan Academy and doing their exercies. 
- Watching and taking notes on the college board AP CSP videos. I will also take practice quizzes on college board.
- Going though exersices on W3 schools. This would be a great way for me to learn how to code.
