title: Computer Science Experiance Reflection
--- 

# Start
My computer science journey started the summer after freshman year. I was a part of Fernlingo's Java Mentorship Program. In this, I was partnered with a high school senior who was passionate about coding. I learned basic sytax and practiced running simple lines of code in Replit. 

# Now 
In my junior year, I'm taking AP Computer Science Principles. I have no prior knowlege expect the summer mentorship program. So far, I have learned how to make a repository using github and how to make changes to it. I also learned about info DBs and basic python lines of code.
