- computing system: group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose 
- computer network: group of interconnected computing devices that are capable of sending+recving data.
    - a type of computing system 
- path b/w two computing devices on a network 
    - sender 
    - reciver 
- routing: the process of finding a path from sender to reciver 
- bandwidth of a computer network: max amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time 
    - meaured in bits per second
- packet: is a small amount of data sent over a network, includes the source and destination
