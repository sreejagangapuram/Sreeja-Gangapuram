# Skills I have obtained
As my priamary role as a scrum master I have learned how to manage a team of four to five people. I have learned how to work with different groups of people with different work habits and skills for a common goal. In additon, I got my introdruction to coding. I got a basic introduction to python, javascript, and using databases in a project. In addition, I have obtained the skill of perservarance as I spent long hours debugging my code and attempted to figure out why it wasn't working. The live reviews made it clear to me how important it is to present and be able to discuss your work rather than simply turning in an assignment and forgetting about it. I believe that despite being at times extremely challenging and frustrating, this class has taught me the most and given me the most experience for real-world situations in my future career.

# Highs and Lows from Year
One of the things I battled with the most this year was deployment, as I believe you and many of my peers are aware. I've struggled with it ever since I first tried it. But now that I've obtained assistance from my colleagues and from you on deployment, some of the procedures actually make sense to me. On the plus side, this year has been filled with numerous highs for me, like learning how to write and debug backend, doing my first CRUD operations with javascript and python, and discovering how to troubleshoot and fix bugs on my own.

# Future plans with CompSci
Learning about styling using tools like css, html, and bootstrap was one of my favorite aspects of this program. I intend to pursue computer science in the future, so having a high school background in computer science will be helpful. Because computer science is becoming a vital part of many people's daily life, there are numerous paths I can follow in this field.

# Future plans in Education/Career
I plan to major in cs in college and hopefully work at some sort of technology or cybersecurity firm. 

# Other, you pick
Next year, I plan to take CSA. I have heard a lot about the fact that CSA is based on the language java. So this summer, I plan to solidify my python language knowlege and learn java.
