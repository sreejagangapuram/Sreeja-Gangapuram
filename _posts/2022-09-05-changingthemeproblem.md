# Changing Remote Theme Problems
I changed my remote theme to Cayman. Here are the problems I found. 

## Screenshot of Temporarily Changing Remote Theme to Cayman
My code change: 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/4.png" width="1000" height="600"> 

The theme changes reflected in my website: 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/0.5.png" width="1000" height="600"> 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/1.png" width="1000" height="600"> 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/2.png" width="1000" height="600"> 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/3.png" width="1000" height="600"> 

## The Problems 
- The menu bar of my website went away and my pages on my menu disappeared. 
- A large area of my blog is taken up by the blue/green bar and my name. 
- The box around each individual post went away and all of the posts are listed as bullet points. 
- A change in font.
