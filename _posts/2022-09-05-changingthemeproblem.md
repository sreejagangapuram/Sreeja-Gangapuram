## Screenshots of Temporarily Changing Remote Theme to Cayman
My code change:

The theme changes reflected in my website: 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/0.5.png" width="1000" height="600"> 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/1.png" width="1000" height="600"> 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/2.png" width="1000" height="600"> 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/3.png" width="1000" height="600"> 

## The Problems 
After changing the theme of my blog from the default, minima, to Cayman, I noticed many changes. Firstly, the menu bar of my website went away and my pages on my menu disappeared. All of the links were gone. Next, a large area of my blog was taken up by a blue/green bar. The font also changed. Next, the box around each individual post went away and all of my posts were listed as bullet points.
