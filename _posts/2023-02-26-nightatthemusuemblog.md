Under our guidence, some of our friends played our game and listened to an explanation of our login and signup systems.

I visted other CSP presentations and listened to them. I played my friend's game called wordle. I learned a creative way to use an API with words to make a wordle game.

I then visited the ceramics room. I had a fun time looking at my friend's work and the work of my peers.

I also visited the AP Studio Art classroom to look at my friend's art. My friend showed me around and it was nice to see the work that other art classes are doing. I'm also planning on taking AP Studio Art next year so it was nice to preview the work that I might be doing.
