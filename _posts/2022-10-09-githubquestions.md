# Questions and Answers for Hacks
What is the main repository for your project?

Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control? Look at this tool for guidance.
- No, we didn't create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control. But my group is planning to make one because it can help make the process of commiting our final project more streamlined. 

Do you have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to your Code Base?
- No, we don't have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to our Code Base, but we think it's a good idea to create one.

- We haven't considered making pull requests to track development, but we plan to read the attached blog post on how to ultilize them.
