# Design and Successes
(check out other post for outline/planning of quiz).

## Program Purpose and Function
I don't have a video explaining my code or a written response, but I will attempt to explain my code to my teacher during my live review. 

## Data Abstraction
In my code, I have a variable called "score." With each correct answer, this variable increments by one. In the end of the quiz, this value (out of 3), shows up on the last screen.

## Managing Complexity
As a result of my code not being too complex, I didn't have selected lists to manage complexity in my code. But this is something I should keep in mind when coding future projects. 

## Procedural Abstraction
I don't have any procedures with parameters in my code, but if I would impletment one, I would probably use one for my score variable where it increments by one for each correct answer. 

## Algorithm Implementation
My code has iteration when displaying the incremented score in my code. I understand my code well enough to explain the steps to my teacher during my live review on monday. 

## Testing
The parameters that I have in my code concern the correct and incorrect answers. For example, the sound "correct" only appears when the correct answer is chosen. And the score only increments when the correct answer is chosen. 

# Discoveries 
I discovered that youtube and online reasources can be very helpful when trying out new lines of code. I used youtube in combination with the code.org articles in order to understand the uses for each piece of code. 

# Challenges 
One challenge I faced was not having a clear plan to use. When I started to create a quiz without a plan, I became easily confused on what I had to do next. Making a plan really helped me develop my ideas. In addition, I struggled with understanding what each piece or section of code was used for. Lastly, sometimes errors popped up when I attempted to use the text code instead of the blocks. It took me a while in order to fix these errors.
