# My Mistakes and Reflection
I worked with Ekam on this test, so I only got one question wrong: Question 42. This question is representative of skill 1.A. I should probably use the college board videos to review this skill. As a result of doing this MC, I realized that I would have made many more mistakes if I was working on my own, so I learned that collaboration was very helpful in doing these questions so that we could talk them out. 

### Q42 - Car manufacturer simulations
Skill 1.A: Investigate the situation, context, or task.

I put C, "Using simulation software can help to identify safety issues by providing data about how different mechanical components will interact in a wide variety of situations and The manufacturer can present simulation software to customers to demonstrate different design possibilities." while the correct answer was D, which includes all of the answer choices. C is incorrect because the first answer choice, "Using simulation software can save the company money by helping to compare designs early in the process, before prototype cars are built" is also a reason to use simulation software because it is talking about using a simulation to support monetary gains by testing before acutally building the car.
