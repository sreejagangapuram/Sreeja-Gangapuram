# Student 1 

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | This didn't earn the point because the purpose in both the video and the response weren't specific. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 2. The written response shows both code segments and explains the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | I initally thought this earned the point, but in reality, according to college board, the response didn't show how the list manages complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 4. It has a description of a prodcedure. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 5. It descibes an algorithm really well. | 
| Testing | Content Cell | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 6. It shows the results of two calls. |
