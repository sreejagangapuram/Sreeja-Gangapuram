**I got this question wrong. I put C, 1 and 3 only while the correct answer was D, 1, 2, and 3. C is incorrect because the average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can also be determined by calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied. D is correct because all of the bullet points can be determined from the data presented in the table.

**I got this question wrong. I put B, the sender's private key while the correct answer was D, the recipient's private key. B is correct because the sender’s private key cannot be used to decrypt the message. Adn D is correct because in public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key.
