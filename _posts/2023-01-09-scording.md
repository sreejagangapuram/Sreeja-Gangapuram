# Student 1

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | I thought that this would earn the point, but according to college board, this didn't earn the point because in the response, the student didn't decribe the purpose of the code but only described the functionality. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | This doesn't earn the point because a list that is described isn't used in the program. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | This doesn't earn the point because the written response doesn't decribe how the list manages complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | This doesn't earn the point because it doesn't decribe the functionality of the procedure. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | This doesn't earn the point because the student needed to add more detail about their algorithm in their response. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 6 and explains the two calls. | 

# Student 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 1. The video shows the code running and the written response includes the input and output. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 2. The written response shows both code segments and explains the list name and its functionality. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 3. It has a list that manages complexity and talks about what would happen if the list wasn't present. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 4. It describes a procedure with four different parameters. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 5. It has sequencing, iteration, and selection. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 6. It shows the results of two calls and describes the two calls. | 

# Student 3

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | I initally thought got full points for this section, but in reality they didn't earn the point because they didn't have the purpose defined. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 2. The written response shows both code segments and shows a list in a loop. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 3. It has a list and talks about what would happen if the list wasn't present. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 4. It has a description of the functionality of a prodcedure and highlights the procedure itself. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 5. It has an algorithm with selection, iteration, and sequencing and decribes the algoirthm. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 6. It shows the results of two calls with two different results and the specific conditions being tested in each call. | 

# Student 4

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The student got the point because they fullfilled all of the requirements for row 1. Their video and written response has the input, output, and program purpose + function clearly shown/described. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | I incorrectly thought that the student earned the point for this section. But college board didn't agree. The student didn't earn the point because the data stored in their list wasn't in use in their program. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | I incorrectly thought that the student earned the point for this section. But college board didn't agree. The student didn't earn the point because their list isn't being used in their code to manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student got the point because they fullfilled all of the requirements for row 4. They had a good procedure and decribed the functionality of it. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student got the point because they fullfilled all of the requirements for row 5. Their algorithm has all three required parts and they describe iteration, selection, and sequencing. | 
| Testing | 0 | 0 | The student didn't earn the point because they only describe the conditions tested, not the arguments of the code execution. | 


# Key Learnings and Reflection 
From this grading activity, I learned that I have some discrepancies in my scoring versus the ap scording. I realized that the the written response needs to have all parts from the rubric. Even if I miss one part of the written part, I loose the entire point. So I must be careful to influde all aspects of the rubric in the written response. In addition, to fullfill all requirments, I need lists, an algorithm, and good explanations of my code in my written response. Lastly, I learned that its very easy to loose points if not all parts of a section are fullfilled, some students had all but one part and lost a point.
