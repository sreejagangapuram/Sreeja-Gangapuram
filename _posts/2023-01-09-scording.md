# Student 1

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | I thought that this would earn the point, but according to college board, this didn't earn the point because in the response, the student didn't decribe the purpose of the code but only described the functionality. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | This doesn't earn the point because a list that is described isn't used in the program. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | This doesn't earn the point because the written response doesn't decribe how the list manages complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | This doesn't earn the point because it doesn't decribe the functionality of the procedure. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | This doesn't earn the point because the student needed to add more detail about their algorithm in their response. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 6 and explains the two calls. | 

# Student 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 1 | I initally thought that the student didn't define the program purpose in the video, but according to college board they got the point. It doesn't have to be stated. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 2. The written response shows both code segments and explains the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 3. It has a list that manages complexity and talks about what would happen if the list wasn't present. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 4. It has a description of the functionality of the prodcedure. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 5. It descibes how the algorithm works. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | This earns the point because it fullfills all of the requirements for row 6. It shows the results of two calls with two different results. |

# Key Learnings and Reflection 
From this grading activity, I learned that the written response needs to have all parts from the rubric. Even if I miss one part of the written part, I loose the entire point. So I must be careful to influde all aspects of the rubric in the written response.
