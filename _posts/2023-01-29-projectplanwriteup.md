# Code Plan 
## Row 1 - Program Purpose and Function
- Purpose: Allow users to log in or create an account so that they can entertain themselves by playing a matching game.
- Function: It takes in user information in order to order the highest scores in a leaderboard.

- The variables are the email, username, and password. 

## Row 3 - Managing Complexity 
- A list that stores the users username, email, and password. 

## Row 4 - Procedural Abstraction 
- The creation of the database, the info in the database being called to check if it matches up with the user's input. 

## Row 5 - Algorithm Implementation 
- The checking if information in the database match up with the user's input.

## Row 6 - Testing 
- User input of their username, email, and password 
- Output 1: If user exists in the database, then consule output should show them being logged in. 
- Output 2: If the user doesn't exist in the database, then a message should pop up, promting the user to make an account.
