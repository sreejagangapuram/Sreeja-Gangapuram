# Changing Remote Theme Problems
I changed my remote theme to Cayman. Here are the problems I found. 

## Screenshot of Temporarily Changing Remote Theme to Cayman
My code change: 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/haha1.png" width="700" height="600"> 

The theme changes reflected in my website: 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/haha2.png" width="700" height="600"> 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/haha3.png" width="700" height="600"> 

## The Problems 
- The menu bar went away and all of my pages became crammed on the upper left side. 
- The space between the box of a post and the end of the page is very small. The length of the posts is taking up the entire length of the screen. 
- A change in font.
