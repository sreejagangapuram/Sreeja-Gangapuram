I didn't have any problems with these multiple choice questions. I got all three correct. All of the questions were answered in the review videos, so they were very helpful. 

# 1.2 Program Purpose

I did the quiz before watching the videos, so my score wasn't good. But after watching the videos, I fully understand all of the questions. I don't have any issues with the content for this topic. 

# 1.3 Program Design and Development

I misinterpeted the first two questions of the quiz. For the first one, I said that the code prints all even numbers while the code is printing all of the odd numbers in reality. For the second question, I said that the sum of the parameters should not equal 0. In reality, only the value of the parameter x should not equal 0, because then that would make the total value undefined.
