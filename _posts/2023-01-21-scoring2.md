# Student 1

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | My scoring matched the college board scoring perfectly. The student fullfilled the requirmements for the college board rubric row 1. Their video shows their running program and their written respeonse describes the functionality very well. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The student didn't fullfill the requirments for rubric row 2. The students list doesn't access the data. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student didn't fullfill the requirments for rubric row 3. The list that the student used doesn't manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The student didn't fullfill the requirments for rubric row 4. The written response didn't include how the procdeure contributes to the overall program. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirements for rubric row 5. Their algorithm shows sequencing, selection, and iteration. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirements for rubric row 6. They showed two different procedure calls. | 

# Student 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 1 | For this row, I assumed that the student didn't earn the point because I thought that their program purpose wasn't clear enough. But in reality, the student earned the point accourding to college board and fullfilled all of the requirments for row 1. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirements for rubric row 2. A list is properly described. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirements for rubric row 3. A list is used to manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirements for rubric row 4. A procedure was fully described. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirements for rubric row 5. Their algorithm is fully explained in their written response. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirements for rubric row 6. They showed two different procedure calls. | 


# Student 3

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | For this student sample, my scoring matched the college board scoring. The student recived the pint for rubric row 1 because their video described the program function and their written response explains the input and output. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The student didn't recive the point for rubric row 2. The data isn't used by the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student didn't recive the point for rubric row 3. The response doesn't explain why how the program would be written without a list. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The student didn't recive the point for rubric row 4. The procedure doesn't have a parameter. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The student didn't recive the point for rubric row 5. The student's algorithm is missing iteration, but has selection and sequencing. | 
| Testing | 0 | 0 | The student didn't recive the point for rubric row 6. The two outputs of the two calls weren't shown. | 

# Student 4

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirmements for the college board rubric row 1. Both their video and written response shows the input, output, and program function. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirmements for the college board rubric row 2. The written response details data stored in a list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirmements for the college board rubric row 3. A list is used to manage complexity, and the student explains what how the code would be written without the list. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirmements for the college board rubric row 4. A procedure is described and called. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student fullfilled the requirmements for the college board rubric row 5. The algorithm has selection, sequencing, and iteration. | 
| Testing | 1 | 0 | For rubric row 6, I thought that the student recived the point, but in reality, they didn't according to college board because specific arguments passed through the parameters aren't described. | 



# Key Learnings and Reflection 
From grading more of these student samples, I recived more clarity of what gains the point from college board and what doesn't. The student won't get they point if they don't have even one of the three parts of an algorithm: selection sequencing, or iteration. All three parts need to be there to gain the point. I realized that the the written response needs to have all parts from the rubric. Even if I miss one part of the written part, I loose the entire point. In addition, I also learned that in the written response, I need to have the input, output, function, a list that manages complexity, an algoirthm, and two different calls and their results.
