## App or Webpage Ideas Brainstorming
- A study app: an app that allows students to organize/plan their homework tasks, tests, quizzes, due dates. It can also have a timer to keep them on track. 
- A workout planner/tracker

## Questions to answer

What are all the technical requirements for the project? 
- Row 1: Program Purpose and Function
- Row 2: Data Abstraction
- Row 3: Managing Complexity
- Row 4: Procedural Abstraction
- Row 5: Algorithm Implementation
- Row 6: Testing

What can you design now?
- I can start working on an outline. 
- I can design the graphics and the visual aspects of the project now. 

What do you need to learn to complete the Create Performance Task design process? 
- A programming language. Probably HTML for a website.
- The syntax
- How to properly/effectively outline a project. 

What resources do you have available to start on the design journey?
- College Board
- Khan Academy
- W3 Schools 
- Youtube 
- The APCSP Fastpages and blogs from former students.

## What I will do personally to improve my coding skills before create performance task. 

Here are some ideas that I will use to learn more about coding: 
- Going though the AP computer science principles videos on Khan Academy and doing their exercies. 
- Watching and taking notes on the college board AP CSP videos. I will also take practice quizzes on college board.
- Going though exersices on W3 schools. This would be a great way for me to learn how to code.
