## Question 43 - Result of call to proc2 procedure

I got question 43 wrong, which is representative of skill 4.B, which is about determing the result of code segments. The question shows a procedure and asks for the result. I put C, "to you birthday happy," while the correct answer is D, "to you happy birthday." C is wrong because the words "to you" are printed before the word "birthday," which is incorrect. Answer D is correct because the procedure excecutes all of the steps to lead to the correct result. 

## Question 48 - Benefit of using a simulation over an experiment

I also got question 48 wrong, which is representative of skill 1.A investigating the situation, context, or task. The question is asking about a benefit of using a simulation over an experiment. I asid A and C "A simulation allows investigation of a phenomenon without the real-world limitations on time, safety, or budget" and "A simulation always produces the same output, so its results can be verified." But the correct answers are A and B. B is "A simulation can be used to model real-world events that are impractical for experiments." C is wrong because a simulation doesn't always produce the same result. I got one of the answers right, but the other wrong. Next time, I need to remember to read both of the answer choices carefully.
