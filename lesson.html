<blockquote>
<p>A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:"yes" or "no".
There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decidable Problems</li>
<li>Undecidable Problems</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>decidable problem</strong> is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not.</p>
<p>An <strong>undecidable problem</strong> problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem.</p>

<p>The halting problem is an example of an <strong>undecidable</strong>. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no way</strong> to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not.</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let's call this algorithm <code>HaltChecker</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>HaltChecker</code> analyzes the program,<code>program P</code>, and its input,<code>input I</code>. If <code>program P</code> halts with <code>input I</code>, <code>HaltChecker</code> returns an output of "halts". If <code>program P</code> doesn't halt(runs forever) with <code>input I</code>, <code>HaltChecker</code> returns an output of "never". For example, in the code where it tests if variable <strong>number</strong>, the <strong>code runs forever</strong>, so <code>HaltChecker</code> returns an output of <strong>"never"</strong>.</li>
<li>Then, we add another algorithm called <code>Reverser</code> which reverses <code>HaltChecker</code>'s output. So, if "never" is the output of <code>HaltChecker</code>, then the output of <code>Reverser</code> is <strong>"halts"</strong>. It's also the same the other way around: if <code>HaltChecker</code> has an output of "halts", then <code>Reverser</code> has an output of <strong>"never"</strong>.</li>
<li>We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code.</li>
<li><strong>Since <code>Reverser</code> is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints "never" when in fact there is an end(As proved by <code>HaltChecker</code>), and how it also prints "halts" when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by <code>HaltChecker</code>). As a result, <code>HaltChecker</code> is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Q</strong>: If <code>Reverser</code> is causing the problem, why not remove it?</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong>: Removing <code>Reverser</code> will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate.</li>
