<mark>Unit 2 Binary/Data Terms</mark>
- **Bits**: most basic unit of informartion in computing. 
- **Bytes**: a group of 8 digits or bits operating as one unit. 
- **Hexadecimal / Nibbles**: base 16 numbering system 
- **Binary Numbers**: numbers expressed in the base two numbering systems. they are only 0s and 1s. 
- **Unsigned Integer**: non-negative integers. 
- **Signed Integer**: 32-bit datum, encodes an integer in the range ([-2147483648 to 2147483647]). 
- **Floating Point**: a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. 
    - Examples: 5.2, 333.09, etc. 
- **Binary Data Abstractions**: reducing data to simplify it's entirety. 
- **Boolean**: logical data type that can have only the values true or false. 
- **ASCII**: a character encoding scheme in which each character is represented by a 7-bit (originally) or 8-bit binary sequence. 
- **Unicode**: 16-bit character set which describes all of the keyboard characters.
- **RGB**: a problem solving approach (algorithm) to find a satisfactory solution where finding an optimal or exact solution is impractical or impossible.
- **Data Compression**: the process of encoding data so that is needs fewer bits/bytes to represent it.
- **Lossy**: data encoding and compression technique that deliberately discards some data in the compression process.
- **Lossless**: data compression algorithm that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data

<mark>Unit 3 Algorithm/Programming Terms</mark>
- **Variables**: a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.
- **Data Types**
    - String (or str or text) - combination of any characters
    - Character (or char) - single letters
    - Integer (or int) - whole numbers
    - Float (or Real) - numbers that contain decimal points, or for fractions.
    - Boolean (or bool) - data is restricted to True/False or yes/no options 
- **Assignment Operators** - operator used to assign a new value to a variable. 
- **Managing Complexity with Variables**: with variables, a complex entity can be manipulated. 
- **Lists**: an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.
- **2D Lists**: a two-dimensional array can hold more than one set of data
- **Dictionaries**: an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs
- **Class**: written in a in a defined structure to create an object. 
- **Algorithms**: a list set of instructions, used to solve problems or perform tasks. 
    - **Sequence**: algorithms do tasks in the order of specification.
    - **Selection**: helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision.
    - **Iteration**: if a condition is true, then the code can repeat.
- **Expressions**: combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted to create a new value. 
- **Comparison Operators**: compare two values against one another.
- **Booleans Expressions and Selection**: if a condition is true or false, there is a differnet outcome. 
- **Booleans Expressions and Iteration**: if a condition is true, the code repeats an earlier step. 
- **Truth Tables**: have two values 
    - 0 = off, false
    - 1 = on, true
    - Examples 
        - 0 and 0 = false. And operator means both needs to be true. 
        - 0 or 1 = true. Either or. 
        - Use this in conditionals (selection). 
        - XOR = exclusive or. 
        - Or = similar to true or false. 
- **Characters**: display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol.
- **Strings**: ordered sequences of characters. 
- **Length**: the number of symbols output. 
- **Concatenation**: operation of joining two strings together.
- **Upper**: used to check if the argument contains any uppercase characters. 
    - returns "True" if all characters in the string are uppercase, Otherwise, It returns "False".
- **Lower**: returns the lowercase string from the given string.
- **Traversing Strings**: the process of going through a String one character at a time, often using loops.
- **Python If, Elif, Else conditionals**
    - If: statement executes a piece of code when one statement is false and the following statement is true. 
    - Elif: first if statement isn't true, but want to check for another condition.
    - Else: executes if "if" isn't true. 
- **Nested Selection Statements**: when more than one decision must be made before the appropriate action can be taken.
- **Python For While loops with Range with List**: returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.
- **Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue**: a statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition.
- **Procedural Abstraction**: have variable parameters. 
- **Python Def procedures**: procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name.
- **Parameters**: variable used in a function to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the function.
- **Return Values**: function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task.
