    "As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week.  <mark>Variables all have a type</mark>: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types.  In Python, variables are given a type at assignment,  Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections.  Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection.  \n",
    "2. Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Key Types of Variables: tring, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary. \n",
    "- Difference between a primative and a collection: A primative type is a basic building block of programming. A collection requires objects for manipulation. "

    "- As we learned above, a List is a data type: class 'list'\n",
    "- A <mark>'list' data type has the method '.append(expression)'</mark> that allows you to add to the list.  A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances.\n",
    "- In the example below,  the expression is appended to the 'list' is the data type: class 'dict'\n",
    "- At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure.  This is a <mark>list of dictionaries</mark>, or a collection of many similar data patterns.  The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts.  Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so."
