    "        - Lists and dictionaries are both referred to as collection types in Python.\n",
    "        - Data types including integers, floats, booleans, and characters are referred to as primitive types. These types do not contain subtypes and only store a single value. Collection types, on the other hand, are data structures that may store numerous values or objects.\n",
    "        - In Python, lists are arranged groups of elements, where each member may be any sort of data. Because they allow for the storage of several values in a single variable, lists are regarded as collection types.\n",
    "    - Is the list passed into bubble sort \"pass-by-value\" or \"pass-by-reference? Describe why in relation to output.\n",
    "        - When a list is supplied into a function like bubble sort in Python, it is passed by reference.\n",
    "        - In other words, any modifications made to the list inside the function will have an impact on the list outside the function. This is because, instead of making a new copy of the complete list when a list is supplied to a function, its'reference' is passed.\n",
    "        - In the case of bubble sort, the initial list is changed when elements are switched around within the function. Because the function operates directly on the referred list, the adjustments are reflected in the output.\n",
    "- Implement new cell(s) and/or organize cells to do the following.\n",
    "    - Create your own list\n",
    "    - Use your expertise sorting algorithm (selection, insertion, merge). Note, I got my bubble sort from Geek for Geeks and made modifications. Each student in a group should have a unique algorithm.\n",
