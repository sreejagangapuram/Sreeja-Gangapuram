    "### Halting Problem Example:\n",
    "- In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let's call this algorithm `HaltChecker`.\n",
    "- `HaltChecker` analyzes the program,`program P`, and its input,`input I`. If `program P` halts with `input I`, `HaltChecker` returns an output of \"halts\". If `program P` doesn't halt(runs forever) with `input I`, `HaltChecker` returns an output of \"never\". For example, in the code where it tests if variable **number**, the **code runs forever**, so `HaltChecker` returns an output of **\"never\"**.\n",
    "- Then, we add another algorithm called `Reverser` which reverses `HaltChecker`'s output. So, if \"never\" is the output of `HaltChecker`, then the output of `Reverser` is **\"halts\"**. It's also the same the other way around: if `HaltChecker` has an output of \"halts\", then `Reverser` has an output of **\"never\"**.\n",
    "- We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code.\n",
    "- **Since `Reverser` is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints \"never\" when in fact there is an end(As proved by `HaltChecker`), and how it also prints \"halts\" when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by `HaltChecker`). As a result, `HaltChecker` is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem.**\n",

    "- **Q**: If `Reverser` is causing the problem, why not remove it?\n",
    "- **A**: Removing `Reverser` will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate.\n",

    "### Extra Things to Notice\n",
    "- Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever.\n",
