    "- A **procedure** is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.\n",
    "- Procedures are referred to by different names, such as **method** or **function**, depending on the programing language.\n",
    "- Parameters are input values of a procedure. **Arguments** specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called.\n",
    "- A procedure call interrupts the **sequential** execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was **called**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 2:\n",
    "- When calling procedures, it's important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of **statements**.\n",
    "- If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and **inputting** the arguments.\n",
    "- If the procedure returns some sort of data like a **boolean** or **value**, then you will assign that value to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. \n",

    "## Procedural Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- One type of abstraction is **procedural** abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it\n",
    "- This is very helpful in managing **complexity** in a program\n",
    "- Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called **modularity**\n",
    "- A procedural abstraction may **extract** shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity\n",
    "- When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it\n",

    "- Making sure to include the right arguments so the **procedure** can do what its supposed to do is crucial"
