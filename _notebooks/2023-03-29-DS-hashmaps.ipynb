    "\n",
    "> A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a <mark>dictionary.</mark> \n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The typical time complexity of a hashtable is <mark>O1, bc each key only has one value.</mark>"

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",

    "### Hands down, Willow is my Taylor Swift song of all time. I love how simple and calming the music is. No matter what mood I'm in, Willow always calms me down. Also, the metaphor of the water being Taylor and the ship, a man, causing ripples in her life is very creative. In addition, Taylor's voice is so soft and beautiful in this song. The song's overall simplicity and metaphors make it breathtaking. I also have a personal connection with this song. Last year, I took AP Euro and for this class I had to take long and tiring textbook notes. I was up at 1:00 every day doing the notes. Near the end of my notetaking, when I was stressed and ready to give up, I always listened to Willow. It always managed to calm me down with the beautiful music. And before I went to bed, it was always the last song I listened to. It always made me fall asleep with a smile. "
