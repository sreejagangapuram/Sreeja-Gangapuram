<p>From grading more of these student samples, I recived more clarity of what gains the point from college board and what doesn’t. The student won’t get they point if they don’t have even one of the three parts of an algorithm: selection sequencing, or iteration. All three parts need to be there to gain the point. I realized that the the written response needs to have all parts from the rubric. Even if I miss one part of the written part, I loose the entire point. In addition, I also learned that in the written response, I need to have the input, output, function, a list that manages complexity, an algoirthm, and two different calls and their results.</p>
