  <li>purpose of computing innovations: <strong>to solve problems or pursue interests thru creative expression</strong>
</li>
  <li>an understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides devolopers with an improved ability to develop innovation</li>
  <li>computing innovations:
    <ul>
      <li>applications: games, social media, business, productivity</li>
      <li>physical devices: computers, smart phones/tablets, smart “things”, wearables</li>
      <li><strong>systems: E-commerce, cloud services, E-mail</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Guiding questions:
    <ul>
      <li>why does the computing ino=ovation exist?</li>
      <li>what problems does the computing innovation solve?</li>
      <li>what does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>investigating examples:
    <ul>
      <li>social media applications
        <ul>
          <li>allows users to connect from a distance and archive activities</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>E-commerce
        <ul>
          <li>allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>digital assistant device
        <ul>
          <li>allows users to control their devices hands-free, making them safer while driving or more conveinent when multi-tasking</li>

  <li>
<strong>program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program.</strong> input forms: tactile, audio, visual, or text</li>
  <li>an event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program</li>
  <li>events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution</li>
  <li>inputs usually affect the outpout produced by a program</li>
  <li>in event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control</li>
  <li>input can come from a user or other programs</li>
  <li>program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text</li>
  <li>program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state (ex:internal values)</li>
  <li>input:
    <ul>
      <li>tactile (touch)</li>
      <li>audio</li>
      <li>visual</li>
      <li>text (including numerical values)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>what input devices accept:
    <ul>
      <li>smart phone/tablet</li>
      <li>laptop computer</li>
      <li>gaming console</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>event driven enviorment: “events” are triggered by some action, usually sends input to the program</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>mouse clicks</li>
      <li>screen taps/swipes (force touch)</li>
      <li>physical button entries</li>
      <li>keyboard entires</li>
      <li>audio</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>what does input acconplish:
    <ul>
      <li>affects the output. what outputs are produced by a device?
        <ul>
          <li>visual</li>
          <li>audio</li>
          <li>tactile (touch/feel)</li>
          <li>text</li>
        </ul>

      <li>outputs
        <ul>

          <li>gaming console</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>an action triggers an event:
    <ul>
      <li>action may be initated by the user or other program/device</li>
      <li>program jumps to code segement according to event
        <ul>
          <li>code is executed</li>
          <li>output or additional events are triggered</li>
          <li>executed as called</li>
        </ul>

  <li>A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. a program is often referred to as software.</li>
  <li>a code segment is a collection of pogram statements that is part of a program</li>
  <li>a program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations</li>
  <li>the behavior of a program is how a prgram functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it</li>
  <li>a program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accompish this function</li>
  <li>a program: a collection of statements
    <ul>
      <li><strong>statement: a single command</strong></li>
      <li>code segment: group of statements
        <ul>
          <li>exectued accoridng to the rules ofo the proframming lanuage</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>a program = software</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>how to describe a code segment:
    <ul>
      <li>state what is does, simply
        <ul>
          <li>so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>or include how it does what it does:
        <ul>
          <li>explain how the code segment functions</li>
          <li>so that someone can expand upon the code segment</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

<p>Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes we do, we are planning on making a wordle. 
Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose?</li>
  <li>Yes we are. A wordle must have many elements that can help us develop our coding skills. 
Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks?</li>
  <li>Yes. All of our team members are interested in this project. 
Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed?</li>
  <li>Yes, people can play our game after the four weeks. 
Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission?</li>
  <li>Most likely. We can add more complexity to our code to achive a higher grade.</li>
