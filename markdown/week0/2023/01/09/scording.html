<p>From this grading activity, I learned that I have some discrepancies in my scoring versus the ap scording. I realized that the the written response needs to have all parts from the rubric. Even if I miss one part of the written part, I loose the entire point. So I must be careful to influde all aspects of the rubric in the written response. In addition, to fullfill all requirments, I need lists, an algorithm, and good explanations of my code in my written response. Lastly, I learned that its very easy to loose points if not all parts of a section are fullfilled, some students had all but one part and lost a point.</p>
