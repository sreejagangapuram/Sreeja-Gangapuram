<p>By scoring the student samples I learned that I need to shown the input, output and program fuction in the video in a short amount of time. In the writtten response, I need to have the input, output, function, a list that manages complexity, an algoirthm, and two different calls and their results. My scoring was different from the college board scoring was in the program purpose and function. College board awarded the point for student 2, while I didn’t. This tells me that you don’t have to specifcally state the purpose in the video. In addition, for the list managing complexity, you have to explain how the list functions.</p>
